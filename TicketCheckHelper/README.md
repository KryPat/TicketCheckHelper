# TicketCheckHelper
This app is suppose to help train conductor to see which seats should be checked, and which are already checked

Connected to tickets database show graphic explanation of which number of seat is not yet checked, should be checked again, or is supposed to not be occupied by somone
who potentially does not have ticket.

In my opinion it could improve route profit and ease conductor work.
